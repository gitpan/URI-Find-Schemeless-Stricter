NAME
    URI::Find::Schemeless::Stricter - Find schemeless URIs in arbitrary
    text.

SYNOPSIS
            require URI::Find::Schemeless::Stricter;

            my $finder = URI::Find::Schemeless::Stricter->new(\&callback);

    The rest is the same as URI::Find::Schemeless.

DESCRIPTION
  schemeless_uri_re
    URI::Find finds absolute URIs in plain text with some weak heuristics
    for finding schemeless URIs. This subclass is for finding things which
    might be URIs in free text. It is slightly stricter than
    URI::Find::Schemeless, as it finds things like "www.foo.com" but not
    "lifes.a.bitch.if.you.aint.got.net"; it finds "1.2.3.4/foo" but not
    "1.2.3.4". This should mean your sectioned lists no longer get marked up
    as URLs...
